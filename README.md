polymathic is a [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) portfolio (and not only) theme. 

I made it for my own portfolio. The theme is called `polymathic`, inspired by individuals with a wide range of talents. The theme focuses on rich and consistent navigation experience, exposing the variety of topics to chose from, yet allowing the user to focus on a single thread of your story once they've made a choice. 

Docs and theme demo are available here [main--polymathic-demo.netlify.app](https://main--polymathic-demo.netlify.app/) 

__Be sure to chek the [demo repo](https://github.com/anvlkv/polymathic-demo/)__ and follow zola docs on [installing and using a theme](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/themes/installing-and-using-themes/#installing-a-theme)

This theme uses [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) scss framework, making the theme styles highly customizable and enabling mobile first theme design.

This theme uses [Animate.css](https://animate.style) for animations.

This theme adds minimal [Open Graph](https://ogp.me/) tags to every page `head`.

You can quickly deploy the theme to [netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/), theme comes with a config file.
