# Polymathic

Polymathic is a [zola](https://www.getzola.org/) portfolio theme. I made it for my own portfolio.

The theme is called `polymathic` as referring to a person of many talents. 
I believe there're many people whom I'd call polymath. 
Web development doesn't have to be one of their strong sides, so they could make use of a theme.

This theme uses [bulma](https://bulma.io/) scss framework, making the theme highly customizable.

You can quickly deploy the theme to [netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/), theme comes with a config file.

Example images for this preview are generated using [OpenAI DALLÂ·E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2).
